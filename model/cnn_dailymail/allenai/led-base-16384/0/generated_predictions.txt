Scientists from the ISPA University Institute in Portugal studied the sounds made by the fish, which contracts muscles in its swim bladders to release air. The creatures, which are usually between 20 inches (50cm) long, are fiercely territorial. The fish's song also serves as a deterrent to love rivals. Researchers studied male mice that were either placed in a cage with a female – or one with just her scent.

When they could merely smell a potential mate, they belted out an extremely shrill and complex song, perhaps in an attempt to make themselves known. But when she was within sight, they serenaded her more softly. This is because the sounds made by the fish were shorter in duration and had lower main frequencies.
